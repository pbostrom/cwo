### Sooner
* Emulate emacs/cider (nrepl.el) - two commands: load top-level form containing cursor; load buffer
* Efficient refresh
* Bulletin board - Request/schedule coding sessions, tutorials, one-on-one, one-to-many, etc.
### Later
* Macro-expansion shortcut
* Load dependencies - on launch; pomegranate
* Containerization - docker.io
